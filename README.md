# Text Classification and Generation App

This project is a web application built using Django that allows users to classify text and generate text based on prompts. It uses pre-trained models from Hugging Face's Transformers library for zero-shot classification and text generation.

## Features

- **Text Classification**: Users can input text, and the app predicts whether the sentiment is positive or negative.
- **Text Generation**: Users can input a prompt, and the app generates coherent text based on that prompt.

## Requirements

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Django
- Transformers library (Hugging Face)
- PyMongo (for MongoDB integration)
